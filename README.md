This program takes data from the TMDB and OMDB APIs and performs several calculations and data visualizations.
In order to get started, acquire an API key from https://www.omdbapi.com/ and https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started.

In the same directory your Python file is located, create a file called "omdbapi.txt" and "tmdbapi.txt", and paste your omdb api key and tmdb api key in each one's respective file. 
Additionally, download the "Movietitles.json" file for an example list of movies, or create your own "Movietitles.json" file in the same directory as your Python file in order to search up and store a data base of your own movies.

The program will create an SQLite database in the same folder as your directory.
